This project is a factorio mod.
Designed to run on factorio version 2.0 with space-age DLC.
Brief purpose of the mod is to create a mini-train entity, the differents are its has no seperation of locomotive and cargo (the mod should auto create invisible locomotive), and run on different rail type (route).
Some of my request maybe impossible due to game limitations, tell me if that the case.
